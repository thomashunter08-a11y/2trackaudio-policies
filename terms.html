      2TRACK regarding the App and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>

             <h2>20. NO WAIVER</h2>
             <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that
     provision or any other provision.</p>

             <h2>21. ASSIGNMENT</h2>
             <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior
